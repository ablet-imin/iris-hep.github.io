## My research:
I have searched Supersymmetric top quarks and Lepton Flavor Universality violation process. Currently, I am searching a process that could break lorentz symmetry with the ATLAS detector.
## My expertise is:
Collider physics and statistics.

## A problem I'm grappling with:
HEP software

## I've got my eyes on:
Solve physics problem with Machine learning. Quantum computing.

## I want to know more about:
Non-collider experiments and quantum computing.
